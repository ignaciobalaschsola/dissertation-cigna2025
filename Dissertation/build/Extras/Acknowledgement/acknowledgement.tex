    I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Cigna Healthcare Spain for providing me with an internship opportunity that played a pivotal role in my professional and academic growth. The company invested significant resources in my development, and I deeply appreciate the experience and support I received.

    A special thank you to my team at Cigna, whose collaboration and encouragement made a lasting impact throughout this journey. Sergio Rodríguez, my boss and supervisor, for his guidance and mentorship, and to my colleagues Iñigo Mendaza, Marta Torralba, and Antonio Viñe, for their support and for fostering such an excellent work environment.

    I would also like to acknowledge Pluralsight, edX, and HarvardX for their exceptional educational resources, which provided me with invaluable knowledge and skills throughout my studies.

    Lastly, I extend my gratitude to everyone who, in one way or another, contributed to this journey.
