\section{Final Considerations}

This project primarily focuses on implementing \textbf{Business 
Intelligence (BI)} as its core component, ensuring the generation 
of valuable insights through \textbf{Tableau dashboards}. 

The \textbf{Machine Learning component} will be explored as a 
complementary phase, depending on \textbf{data viability}. 

In the future, integrating models into \textbf{Azure Kubernetes} 
could enhance the \textbf{automation and scalability} of data 
analysis.

This approach will result in a solid and functional project with 
\textbf{scalability options}, depending on the availability of 
\textbf{resources and the results obtained}.
